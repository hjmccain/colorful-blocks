#Colorful Blocks - A Visual

My aim with this design was to create a colorful, engaging visualization that breaks down the components of an individual economic activity.

Each larger segment of the visualization represents an economic sector of the Seattle aerospace industry (e.g. 2.1.2).

Within a segement, each column represents a sub-sector of that industry (e.g. 'Design of aircraft interiors').

With each column, each of the three colored blocks represents a component of the economic object associated with the sub-sector of the industry (e.g. 'ii' or 'div').

Simply by glancing at a segment of the visualization, the viewer can get a sense of the diversity of the objects that make up an economic sector. Looking closer, the viewer can use the legend to determine which specific objects make up a given activity.

The next step would be to make this visualization interactive, so that the user can click on a segment, column, block, or legend key to get corresponding information about the item that is selected.
